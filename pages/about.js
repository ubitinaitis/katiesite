        thanks for stopping by! i'm ula! :D (OO-la)<br></br><br></br>

        i'm a sophomore at northeastern university purusing a combined bachelors degree in computer science and media arts!<br></br><br></br>

        i'm particularly interested in web development, game development, and the unconventional (yet incredible!) uses of virtual reality. you can explore the work i've done regarding these topics
        under my "coding projects" section!<br></br><br></br>

        i'm passionate about a whole lot of things! i believe heavily in how beneficial having interdisciplinary hobbies and studies can be, and i'm thrilled to be a part of its rise in popularity!
        to me, my art side is just as important as computer science side, to where calling them just "sides" and not one working-together whole feels incorrect...
        i wouldn't be any part of myself without either of them! the left brain can learn a lot from the right one! :) i also believe that diverse, inclusive learning environments aren't just an aid, but a necessity!<br></br><br></br>

        my friends!!<br></br>
